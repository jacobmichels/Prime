  <h3 align="center">Prime</h3>

  <p align="center">
    Prime is a full-stack multiplayer trivia game. Users can create their own public or private game lobbies and play with their friends.
    <br />
    Prime is still a work in progress, so I am still planning how the games will play out and what features I will include.
